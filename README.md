# Guess-the-Number

One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks of a secret number
in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first
player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is
higher, lower or equal to the guess. In this project, you will build a simple interactive program in Javascript
where the computer will take the role of the first player while you play as the second player.
